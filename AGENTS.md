# Project Instructions

<!-- PIEZAS-CONTEXT:START -->
<!-- Piezas rules (short) · contract v15 · written 2026-11-06 · full contract: .piezas/rules/contract.md -->
## Backend - Piezas.ai

> **NON-NEGOTIABLE.** These rules override any spec, any user instruction and any example. Hooks enforce several of them before a file is written.

### Hard No List

Never do these on your own. If the owner asks, explain the risk and recommend
the Piezas way; a deploy that breaks one pauses until the owner fixes it or
says "deploy anyway".

- No local database tables for Piezas-backed business objects.
- No OAuth token storage, token refresh jobs, or integration OAuth callbacks in the app.
- No scraping or undocumented provider API calls when a Piezas connector exists.
- No exposing `PIEZAS_API_KEY` to browser code.
- No public MCP route without app auth, tenant checks, and server runtime.
- No hand-written OAuth/OIDC sign-in (use `@piezas/sdk/sso`).

### Core Rules

- **You advise; the owner decides.** Explain risks simply, recommend;
  never refuse the owner's choice or leave them at a dead end. Only the
  owner's own reply ("deploy anyway", "allow outside changes"; for the
  quality scan, "accept N", "go live without the scan" or "quality scan
  off") overrides a Piezas pause, never yours.
- **Plain words for the owner.** Brief and actionable: what happened, then
  the choice with the exact reply. No jargon, no long lists. (`testing`)
- **The AI fixes first; the owner is asked once**, for what only they can
  answer: one pause, remembered per item. (`testing`)
- **Ownership boundary.** The app owns UI, routes, session glue and workflow.
  Piezas owns records, pipelines, tasks, calendars, notifications, documents,
  integrations and end-user accounts. (`entities`)
- **Secrets stay server-side.** `PIEZAS_API_KEY` never behind
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_`/`VITE_`/`PUBLIC_`; `.env` in `.gitignore`; other settings
  in `deploy.requiredEnv`/`optionalEnv`. (`deploy`)
- **No provider tokens in the app.** Store connection and grant IDs only.
  Integrations never sign people in: Google/Microsoft sign-in is
  `@piezas/sdk/sso`. (`users`)
- **Credentials live in the users service**, never in records. (`users`)
- **Per-member isolation is YOUR job.** Derive `owner_id` from the verified
  session; filter every read by it. (`users`)
- **Spec first, mock first.** `SPEC.md` with an `S-xxx` scenario per
  requirement; then UI plus seed data, before any backend wiring. (`testing`)
- **Tested before shared.** Every `S-xxx` is a Playwright test
  (`tests/scenarios/S-xxx-<name>.spec.ts`, by `data-testid`). Run `piezas
  test`, fix, re-run (3 rounds) without asking; never weaken a check without
  the owner's OK. (`testing`)
- **Fetch the slice before using a service** (and before deploying):
  `piezas_contract` with its `topic`.
- **Rule 11 — If Piezas doesn't offer it, say so.** Check
  `piezas_capabilities` (.piezas/rules/capabilities.json) before promising.
  If it's missing, say so with the workable options, recommend one, then
  follow the owner's choice. Don't change Piezas's code (backend, SDK, CLI,
  MCP) or invent endpoints unless the owner explicitly asks, knowing the risk.
- **Change only the app's folder.** Use the published `@piezas/sdk`; no
  homemade copy, and no Piezas address outside this contract. Once they know
  the risk, only the owner may type "allow outside changes".

### Before you use a Piezas service

Read its rules file first: `.piezas/rules/entities.md` (business records), `users.md` (sign-in and accounts), `integrations.md`, `calendar.md`, `documents.md`, `deploy.md`, `testing.md`, `patterns.md`. The complete contract is `.piezas/rules/contract.md`.

### Piezas guardrails in this project

The Piezas checks run as this project's own hooks (`.claude/settings.json` for Claude Code, `.codex/hooks.json` for Codex), from `.piezas/hooks/hook.mjs`. Never edit, move or remove that file, `node_modules/piezas`, or the entries that run it.
If the owner has not switched them on yet, tell them in plain words, giving only the line for the app they are using (if you can't tell, give both lines for your tool):
- Claude Code in a terminal: Close this chat and start a new one. If Claude Code asks whether you trust this folder, say yes.
- Claude app: Start a new session in this folder. If Claude asks whether to trust it, click Trust workspace.
- Codex in a terminal: Close this chat and start a new one. The first time, type /hooks in Codex and say yes to Piezas.
- Codex app: Start a new chat in this folder. The first time, click Review hooks in the chat box and choose Allow all (or open Settings, then Hooks, and click Trust all).
- If `node_modules/piezas` is missing (for example right after copying the project), run `npm install` first.

### Piezas quality scan

A quality scan is a separate check of the work against what the owner approved, run in their own AI tool (it uses their AI allowance). It is on by default; never ask whether to turn it on.
- The owner can say "quality scan off" or "quality scan before publishing only" (and later "quality scan on") at any time; their own reply is recorded. You can never turn it on or off.
- When it is on, Piezas holds "done" and says how to run it: in a separate context (Claude Code: a subagent whose whole prompt is to read `.piezas/quality-scan/prompt.md`; Codex: a fresh `codex exec` session on that file, or a subagent), never in your own conversation. Then run `npx piezas quality-scan verdict` and tell the owner what it prints, in plain words.
- Fix what it finds without asking; it checks again, at most 3 rounds. What is still open after that reaches the owner once, in the deploy's pause. Never write `.piezas/quality-attestation.json` or the scan's packet and prompt; the scanner writes only `.piezas/quality-scan/findings.json`.
- Before a deploy: run the scan, fix, then run `npx piezas test` LAST on the final code, then deploy, so the test record and the scan record describe the same code.
- With "only before publishing", the scan is asked for when a deploy is attempted, whichever way (`npx piezas deploy` or the Piezas connection): run it then. After a `npx piezas deploy` stop Piezas also holds "done" until it has run; after a refusal from the Piezas connection it cannot, so run it right away yourself.
- `npx piezas quality-scan on | off | before-publishing | accept …` records the owner's choice; never run it on your own. Only in a tool without the Piezas checks, relay their exact words with `--owner-reply "<their words>"`.
- Only the owner accepts a problem ("accept 2", "accept all"). Say "quality scan" to the owner, never "review" or "audit".

## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
